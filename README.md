# Python Plotly Dashboard — Listing Quality & Price
This dashboard explores Bristol’s 2024 Airbnb listings through price, property characteristics, and guest review data. It includes:
- *Price by neighbourhood (scatter map):* reveals spatial variation, with higher prices near parks and southwest Bristol.  
- *Property type pie chart:* shows distribution of property categories, though “Other” and “Entire rental unit” reduce clarity.  
- *Review score heatmap:* compares property types across cleanliness, location, value, accuracy, communication, and check-in.  
- *Review trend line:* shows strong seasonality, with reviews peaking in the holiday season and dropping in January.  
- *Booking availability bar chart:* compares availability over 30/60/90/365 days; lacks data on instant bookings.  
- *Common amenities chart:* ranks amenities by prevalence; would be more useful if focused on critical features like heating or parking.  

Overall, the Plotly dashboard highlights geographic pricing trends, seasonal demand, and consumer preferences, while also pointing to property gaps that Airbnb and hosts could address.  

# Tableau Dashboard — Host Reliability & Behaviour
This dashboard focuses on host performance and reliability across Bristol listings. It includes:
- *Host biography analysis (histogram):* shows most hosts write very short bios, limiting personalisation.  
- *Host to guest response analysis (scatter):* demonstrates correlation between response rate, acceptance rate, and response time; highlights the value of fast responses.  
- *Host growth over time (line chart):* indicates that most hosts are experienced, with registrations peaking mid-decade before falling.  
- *Host responses & listing quality (bar chart):* reveals faster response times link to higher review totals; averages would better show quality.  
- *Host verification analysis (stacked bar):* most hosts are verified and show profile pictures, but bars are hard to distinguish visually.  
- *Superhosts & reliability (grouped bar):* confirms Superhosts deliver superior guest experiences, though axis scaling and over-detailed annotations reduce clarity.  

Overall, the Tableau dashboard highlights the role of host responsiveness, verification, and Superhost status in shaping customer experience, offering Airbnb clear targets for host improvement initiatives.
